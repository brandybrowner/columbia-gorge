				<p>I took this trip at the end of May. It was 80 degrees out. The tour I went on traveled from downtown Portland up into the mountains. We Stopped at a ski lodge on Mount Hood that had little to no visitors but there was snow. It was actually snowing on the day of the visit.</p>

				<p>I used EcoTours as opposed to the Plan Your Trip app. It was cool because I learned alot abot the environment. For example the drive up is really scenic. You see really tall trees. But if you go about a mile in the trees can be all gone curtesy of the lumber trade.</p>
